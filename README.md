# LIA_FlexibleGridSystem
_Flexible GS is made by Teddy Fredricson during his internship at BTH(Bleking Tekniska HÃ¶gskola)._

It is made with inspiration from

https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid
https://gist.github.com/jayj/4012969
http://tylertate.github.io/semantic.gs/

any many other systems found online.

The system uses the power of SASS to create a Semantic Grid System with Flexbox.


Tutorial to the Grid System:
(first of all, you might want to check out https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/, a really good website that explains the basic usage of Flexbox)

1. The first thing you might want to do is download Ruby(unless you're on a mac, then it should be installed already) from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/.
2. Then in the ruby folder, run "Start Command Prompt with Ruby". Go to the directory where you have your files(with 'cd [path]') and install Sass: "gem install sass"
3. To compile the input-file you either write "sass input.scss output.css" to make your 'input.scss'-file compiled to 'output.css' or you write "sass --watch input.scss:output.css" to make Sass watch the file until you tell it to stop. (more information here: http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html)
4. Now you can start using the Grid System.

For example, to make a div-tag a flexbox container, you include one of the following mixins inside the brackets:
@include flex-row,
@include flex-col,
@include flex-row-reverse,
@include flex-col-reverse. Depending on how you want the container to display its items.

@include col(x, y), decides how wide a specific element should be, where x is the width of the column(depending on the value of y, standard is 12).
Note: only values for x is mandatory but if you want to play around with more specific results you can still add a second value that will override the standard.

@include col-offset(x, y), moves the element away from the left side in the x-axis.
Note: only values for x is mandatory.

@include justify-content(x), values for x are flex-start(standard), flex-end, center, space-between, space-around.

@include align-items(x), values for x are flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch(standard).

@include order(x), put integer values as x to change the display order of items (useful when working with responsive websites).

@include align-self(x), values for x are auto(standard), flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch.
